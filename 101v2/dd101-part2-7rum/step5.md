1. Aggregated data in the dashboards is useful, but one of the major benefits that Datadog RUM offers is the ability to dive into granular data.
2. Click into one of the views within the explorer:
   ![explorer view](assets/view.png)
3. By looking into this single view, you can see resources, errors, and user actions associated with this page load. This data can be provided to the responsible engineers to help debug and rectify issues for your users.

Nice work! Now you can reward yourself with a passing grade by typing `grademe`{{execute}} in the terminal.
