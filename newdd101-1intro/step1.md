Welcome to the first section of the Introduction to Datadog course. 

1.  Take a look at the command listed below. See the little curled arrow icon that appears next to it? That means its a clickable command. Just click it and the command will be copied to the terminal and be executed.

    `ls`{{execute}}

2.  In most of the sections of this course you will find the instructions for the course on the left, a simple editor and file explorer on the top right, and a terminal on the bottom right.
3.  Now login to your <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com" target="_datadog">Datadog account</a>. You should have received an email letting you know about the organization we have created for you. Again, we use a separate org to ensure that you don't pollute your production environment.
4.  
5.  At the end of every section, including this one, run `done`{{execute}} when you are finished. Go for it. run it now.
