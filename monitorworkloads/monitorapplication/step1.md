We have updated the configuration of all the components of our app to be in line with what we did in the previous lab. So let's just do a quick review of that. And then we will update the Real User Monitoring ID's to ensure that data is showing up in our account correctly. 

1.  Now lets take a look at what is in the config files. In the IDE tab, navigate to **deploy/generic-k8s/ecommerce-app**. You should see 4 YAML files there for advertisements, db, discounts, and frontend.
    1.  Open the **advertisements.yaml** file in the editor.
    2.  First notice that we have labels set at **metadata** and **spec.template.metadata**. Scroll down to **spec.template.spec.containers.env**. You can see a number of environment variables here, including: `DATADOG_SERVICE_NAME`, `DD_ENV`, `DD_AGENT_HOST`, `DD_LOGS_INJECTION`, `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, and `DD_PROFILING_ENABLED` . These environment variables are all that is needed to enable different features like profiling, and more. 
    3.  You should see similar values set in **discounts.yaml**
