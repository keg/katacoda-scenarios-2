When you are accepting input for logs which you want to visualize, it is necessary to have an allow list or else you are going to end up with multiple value names that look the same.
For example the outcomes may look like the following:
* success
* successful
* fail
* failed
* failure

This makes visualizing and interpreting this data very difficult.
