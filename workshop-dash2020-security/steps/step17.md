# Defining The Detection Rule Tags

You should tag this rule as tags allow you to quickly filter this rule based on these set of tags. Tags are used across the Datadog product and are used to maintain context when pivoting in between products. Here are tags which are specially formatted in the Security Monitoring product, if you define them:
* source
* service
* security
* tactic
* technique

## Source and Service Tags
Rules are typically defined on a single source and service. If so, you should define the source and service here such as `source:my-custom-app` or `source:my-custom-app`.
