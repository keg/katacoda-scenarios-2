Welcome to **Real-time Threat Detection and Remediation** workshop.

In this workshop, you will analyze application code, implement observability best practices, troubleshoot a live environment, and detect threats using Datadog Security Monitoring.

During this workshop, you will modify Python code and work with different Datadog products.

# Environment

The screen is divided into 3 panels:

### Instructions Panel
Located on the left is a sidebar. You can read the instructions for each step there.  
Complete the assignment defined in the "Goals" section. To help you complete the exercises, we provide a "Hints" and "Resources" section.

### User Interface Editor Panel
The top section of the right side of the screen. 

You will be able to access all of the files and edit them. You can also create or delete files.
The editor is pointing at your workspace folder. This folder contains the following folders:

* security-workshop/attacker
* security-workshop/legitimate_users
* security-workshop/server

The only code which you should need to modify is in the `server` folder.
You should not need to look at the attacker code to see how the attacker is attacking the environment. No cheating :)

### Terminal Panel
The bottom section of the right side of the screen. 

This is where you will run all of your Bash commands.
