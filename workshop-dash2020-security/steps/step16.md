# Defining The Detection Rule Message

Datadog recommends using an abbreviated version of the Alerting and Detection Strategy (ADS) framework. Here is a template you can use for your rule.

```
## Goal
Define the goal of your detection rule here

## Strategy
Define your queries and cases here. This should clearly articulate the strategy in words rather than as code. Thus, do not simply repeat the query and cases here.

## Triage and Response
Define how the person responding to this Security Signal should triage and respond to this Security Signal.
```
