Were you aware Datadog has a list of [standard attributes](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/processing/attributes_naming_convention/#default-standard-attribute-list)?
The Logs documentation covers all standard attributes which Datadog has standardized on.
You should map each of the logs attributes in your log function to these standard attributes.
