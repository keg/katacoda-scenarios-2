The training environment used in this course is made up of 5 machines: host01, host02, host03, host04, and host05. These serve the purposes of a utility machine to run scripts from, a load balancer, and three webservers.

The environment is started as soon as you open the Hands-On section. In this staging version, Ansible runs to install everything.

In this exercise we are going to look at how Datadog is configured on .


*Note: In this staging of the Katacoda scenario, startup will take 3 minutes or so. When we go live this should drop to no more than 20 seconds*
