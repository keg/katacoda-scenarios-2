As you now know, etcd is the primary datastore for your Kubernetes cluster. You need to make sure your etcd environment is always healthy, otherwise nothing will work. You will see how to start monitoring etcd as well as what to look for. In this lab, etcd is running on the master node, but you could have 5 or 7 nodes dedicated to etcd alone. Normally the Datadog agent runs on the worker nodes so won't see etcd unless we load the agent on the master node. So for this lab we have added the required tolerations to load the agent only on the master node.
