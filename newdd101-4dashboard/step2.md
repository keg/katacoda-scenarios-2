1.  Add a **Heat Map** with the same metric and click **Done**.

  *Which graphs work well for this metric with 3 hosts?*
1.  Click the pencil icon for some of the graphs. Click the plus sign to the right of the metric to see the different functions available.<br>

1.  Create another Timeseries with the same <code>apache.performance.busy_workers</code> metric.
2.  Now click on the **Metrics** link after **Graph additional** to add another metric line to your graph. 
3.  Add <code>apache.performance.idle_workers</code>.<br>
  *This created a graph with two lines, but sometimes you want a graph with a single line made up of several metrics.*
