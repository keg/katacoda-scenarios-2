In this hands-on section we will enable Application Performance Monitoring in Datadog to work with Kubernetes. Like the logs section, this is not intended to get you up to speed on APM, but rather to show whats special about doing it on Kubernetes. To learn more about APM, refer to the Introduction to APM course on this platform. 
  <br><br>**Note:** *The hands-on environments have a lifetime of one hour from the time you first visit. After one hour you will need to refresh the browser to restart them. Each hands-on exercise is a different environment.*
