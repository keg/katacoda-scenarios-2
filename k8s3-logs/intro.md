In this hands-on section we want to start working with logs on Kubernetes. Logs are a key source of information for Kubernetes and you will need to use the logs to get access to all the relevant information about how your kubernetes environment as well as the applications running on top are performing. Our goal in this hands-on section is to enable the collection of logs with Datadog and to get a basic introduction to their use in the product. You can go into further detail about logs in the dedicated course on this platform.

**Note:** *The hands-on environments have a lifetime of one hour from the time you first visit. After one hour you will need to refresh the browser to restart them. Each hands-on exercise is a different environment.*
