This section is more free form than the previous sections. There are a few pages you should open in other browsers, then build some dashboards that look at the metrics we identify. You can do as much or as little as you like here. 
  <br><br>**Note:** *The hands-on environments have a lifetime of one hour from the time you first visit. After one hour you will need to refresh the browser to restart them. Each hands-on exercise is a different environment.*
