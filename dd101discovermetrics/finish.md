The Metrics Explorer is a great place to go to start discovering metrics in your account or to view a single metric. If you want to work with more metrics or add functions, you should look at notebooks which we will do in a later section.

In the next hands on section we will look at the training environment you are using. This will get you ready for the section after that discussion some of the Datadog integrations.

After completing the hands-on section, move on to the next page so that we can assess your progress. If you don't get a perfect score, come back to this page and try to fix what you missed.
