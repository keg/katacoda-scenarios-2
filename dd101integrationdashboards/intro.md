In the previous sections we started to look at some of the metrics we are collecting. In this section we are going to start looking at actual dashboards available with our account. The metrics and dashboards for Apache HTTPD and haproxy are enabled after you do two things: configure the agent to collect the metrics through the corresponding conf.yaml files, and install the integrations in the Datadog web ui. That's what we are doing here.


*Note: In this staging of the Katacoda scenario, startup will take 3 minutes or so. When we go live this should drop to no more than 20 seconds*
