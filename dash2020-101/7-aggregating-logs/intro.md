We got a taste of APM in the last Hands On. In this section we are going to take a look at Logs. Three of the most important types of data to look at to understand the state of your environment is Metrics, Traces, and Logs. In fact for a long time we talked about the Three Pillars of Observability. Those are the three. We have now looked at Metrics and Traces, so in this exercise we will look at Logs and how to make your Logs more useful.
