Make sure you wait for the **Provisioning Complete** message in the terminal before opening the IDE or the application. 

1.  In the IDE, open `docker-compose-files/docker-compose.yaml`.
2.  As you can see, Logs collection has already been enabled for our application. You can see this by looking at the `environment` section for each service and finding the two `DD_LOGS` variables.
3.  Then you can see that labels have been added for auto discovery to enable logs to be collected and categorized.
4.  Now whatever logs are generated by the services are forwarded to Datadog. 
5.  Let's run **gor** again to get some traffic going on our site. `./gor --input-file-loop --input-file requests_0.gor --output-http "http://localhost:3000"`{{execute}}
6.  Open Datadog and navigate to **Logs**.
7.  Right away we can see logs are being collected and displayed. 
8.  On the left side of the window under **Service** you see each of the services listed. This was generated based on our auto discovery labels. 
9.  Hover over each one. Notice that to the right of whichever one you are hovering over, you see the word **Only**, meaning that if you click here you will Only see that services logs. 
10. Click on **store-frontend**, then try each of the others to see the list of logs update.
11. If you click on the currently selected service, it will go back to showing everything. 
12. Under Source just above that you can see that you can filter based on **ruby**, **python**, or the **agent**. Most of the other **facets** don't apply to our logs.
13. Try clicking on some of the log lines. Notice the details panel that comes out. Depending on the source of the logs, more detail may be displayed here.
